Version 1.1 November 10, 2015
ListingAnalyst now provides both a table of contents and an index of the file it is viewing.

ListingAnalyst no longer requires exclusive access to the file it is viewing.

Data printed by the Farm and Surface Water Routing Processes and Upstream Weighting and Seawater Intrusion packages are now recognized.
